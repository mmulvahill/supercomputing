# Supercomputing

This started as an initial testing of approaches to massively parallel computing
on Google Cloud.  The aim is now expaned to researching and documenting all
high-thoroughput (HTC) and high-performance computing (HPC) options and
researching which computing options fit with which workload type.

## Key terminology

|---|------------------------------------------------------------|
| High-performance computing (HPC) | Individual programs that take advantage of |
|                             | multiple cores and multiple nodes typicaly via MPI |

    - Best for HTC, individual wall times up to several hours, has preemption
      but automatically handles it (retries job)
